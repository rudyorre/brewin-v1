The main issue currently is the type checking for error handling. At the moment, when an expression returns a string, it will accept that. However, with my current implementation it will also accept variables that dont exist and interpret them as strings. Although i could have gotten 9/10 test cases by adding an exception, but this meant that the output of an expression would throw an error if the expression resolves to a string. It's too late for me to go back and change this however since it's a core part of my program, but for project 2 i'll probably create a new internal typing system.
